# Monero-graphics

## Monero propaganda graphics

These graphics were inspired by [a reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/7jvccx/wroc≈Çaw_poland_today/) in the [r/monero](https://www.reddit.com/r/monero) subreddit. They support the [Monero (XMR)](https://www.getmonero.org) cryptocurrency and may be distributed by anyone.

Quickly print your graphics:

1. click on your desired .SVG 
2. right click on the image and open it in a new tab 
3. hit `ctrl/cmd + p` in your browser. 

They are designed in A5 format, but can easily be scaled right before printing. Use factors of 2 for smaller A-sizes (i.e. (50% = A6). Feel free to download any source and edit them as you see fit for your personal use case. New translations [always welcome](https://www.reddit.com/u/diiscotheque).
