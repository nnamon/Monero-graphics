## Monero propaganda graphics

These graphics were inspired by [a reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/7jvccx/wroc≈Çaw_poland_today/) in the [r/monero](www.reddit.com/r/monero) subreddit. They support the [Monero (XMR)](www.getmonero.org) cryptocurrency and may be distributed by anyone.

If you'd like to print these graphics, click on your desired .SVG and hit `ctrl/cmd + p` in your browser. They are designed in A5 format. Feel free to download any source and edit as you see fit for your personal use case.
